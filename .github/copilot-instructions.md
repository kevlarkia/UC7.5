### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (prefer spaces over tabs)
- Follow the language-specific style guides for any code added to this repository
- Ensure proper formatting before committing

## Project Structure

Currently, this is a minimal repository. As the project grows:
- Source code should be organized logically by feature or module
- Keep configuration files at the root level
- Documentation should be kept up to date

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
- Aim for meaningful test coverage

### Code Review
- All changes should be reviewed before merging
- Address feedback constructively
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex functions
- Keep inline documentation concise and relevant
- Update documentation when changing functionality

### Repository Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date with project information
- Document setup instructions and dependencies
- Include examples where helpful

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for the language/framework in use
- Address security vulnerabilities promptly

## Git Workflow

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change or feature
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable

## Additional Guidelines

- Be mindful of dependencies - only add necessary libraries
- Consider backwards compatibility when making changes
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- When in doubt, ask for clarification or guidance
